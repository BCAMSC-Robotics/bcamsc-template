BCAMSC Robotics Template Project
================================
This project is meant to serve as a template for new projects. To use it, clone
the project, then change the remote to a new location for the new project:

````sh
git remote set-url origin https://new-url/project.git
````

After pulling the repository, be sure to execute the `setup.sh` script in order
to use the libraries properly.

Place your code in any files you wish. The main ones to use are `vexuser.c` and
`vexuser.h`.

If you do create additional files, be sure to add them to the list in
`setup.mk`.
